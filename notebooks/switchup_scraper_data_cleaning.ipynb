        "  - run these queries using the appropriate Python connectors\n",
        "  \n",
        "* Bonus: How will this datamodel be updated in the future? Please write auxiliary functions that test the database for data quality issues. For example: how could you make sure you only include the most recent comments when you re-run the script?\n",
